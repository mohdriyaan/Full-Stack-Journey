<!-- A CSS Transition allows you to smoothly change property values over a given duration, 
instead of the change happening instantly.

It’s what creates animations when something like color, size, or position changes.  -->

<!-- Basic Idea:-  
Without a transition:
When you hover over a button, the color changes immediately.

With a transition:
The color gradually fades from one color to another — giving a smooth, animated effect.

transition: property duration timing-function delay;

property → the CSS property to animate (like color, background-color, width, etc.)

duration → how long the animation takes (like 1s or 500ms)

timing-function → how the speed changes during the animation (like ease, linear, etc.)

delay → how long to wait before starting (optional)
