<!-- Cascade:- The order the styles are declared in and linked to matters
Ex:-  
h1{
color: red;
}
h1{
color:purple;
}

Here color purple gets applied

If the second styles document gets added
i.e., <link rel="stylesheet" href="app1.css"/> 
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="app2.css"/>
Then app2.css will overwrite the styles used for elements in app1.css
-->

<!-- Specificity is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules
could apply to the same element. It is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more
specific selector "wins".

Ex:- 
p{                       section p{
 color: yellow;  <<         color:teal;
}                        }

Inline Style CSS > ID > Class > Element

Specificity will be applied only when the elements have the same property

!important will override the specificity.
