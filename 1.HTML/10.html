<!--HTML Entities Codes-->
<!--Start with an ampersand and end with semi colon.
Used to display reserved characters
Also used in place of difficult to type characters
The browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.-->

<h1>1 < 6</h1> <!--< is reserved character so instead we use entity character-->
<h1>1 &lt; 6 &gt; 5 &amp; &hearts; &spades;</h1>
